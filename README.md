# odin-recipes

This is my first The Odin Project project

I am applying the skills I have learned in HTML to produce a recipe page of three sample recipes

I used skills involving embedded images and links. As well as using HTML boilerplate, text styles, and lists

I then published this project to the web.

Thank You,
